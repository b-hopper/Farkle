## Game Description

Farkle is a classic push-your-luck dice game. Players take turns rolling six dice and choosing which to keep for points. The goal is to reach a target score (default: 10,000 points). Players may continue rolling to accumulate more points during their turn ‚Äî but risk losing everything if they Farkle (roll no scoring dice).

The game supports 2+ local players in a pass-and-play format, with persistent player profiles, animated dice rolls, and dynamic UI feedback.

## Core Gameplay

### Objective

Be the first player to reach the target score (default: 10,000 points).

### Turn Flow

1. Start turn ‚Üí Roll all unheld dice
2. Select scoring dice
3. Choose to roll again or hold and end turn
4. If the roll results in no scoreable dice ‚Üí Farkle ‚Üí Lose unbanked points
5. Score carries over only if player banks points via "Hold Dice"
6. Once a player reaches the target score, all others get one final turn
7. Winner is the player with the highest score after final round

### Dice Scoring Rules

- Ones: 100 points each
- Fives: 50 points each
- Three of a kind: face value x100
  - (Three 1s = 1,000)
- Four of a kind: face value x200 (or 2,000 for 1s)
- Five of a kind: face value x300 (or 3,000 for 1s)
- Six of a kind: face value x400 (or 4,000 for 1s)
- Straight (1-6): 1,500 points
- Three pairs: 1,500 points
- Two triplets: 2,500 points

## Systems & Architecture

### Architecture Style

- Modular Singleton-based architecture for core systems (e.g., `TurnManager`, `ScoreManager`, `FarkleGame`, `UIManager`)
- Event-driven communication using `UnityEvent`s
- ScriptableObjects used for configuration (`GameSettings`, `PlayerSettings`)
- Backend communication via `UnityWebRequest` and JSON payloads
- Scene-based structure with additive loading for future menus and overlays

### Core Systems

#### `FarkleGame`

- Central event hub and game state coordinator
- Manages player input lock and main turn resolution loop
- Fires UnityEvents for all gameplay transitions (roll, select, hold, end turn, etc.)

#### `TurnManager`

- Finite State Machine handling turn phases: `START_TURN`, `ROLL_DICE`, `SELECT_DICE`, `END_TURN`, `GAME_OVER`, etc.
- Coordinates UI prompts and state transitions
- Determines final round and winner

#### `ScoreManager`

- Handles calculation and tracking of per-player scores
- Stores turn, selected, and total score
- Evaluates winning score condition and sets `BottomFeedScore`
- Pushes score data to backend when game ends

#### `DiceManager`

- Maintains state of six dice (rolled, held, selected)
- Implements scoring logic for all valid combinations
- Integrates with `ViewController` to animate dice updates

#### `PlayerManager`

- Manages list of `Player` objects (name, score, profile)
- Tracks current and next player based on `TurnManager`
- Handles persistent player stat storage (future: local and cloud sync)

#### `UIManager`

- Manages game UI, buttons, player panel, and splash messages
- Responds to turn state changes
- Controls screen flipping, debug info, and game over display

#### `ViewController`

- Maps dice model data (`Dice[]`) to visual prefab components (`DieView[]`)
- Handles animated dice rolling with variation via DOTween

## üõ°Ô∏è Backend Architecture

### üîß Backend Overview

The backend handles persistent player data for statistics, game history, and leaderboards. While gameplay is limited to local pass-and-play, each user (Google account or anonymous ID) can maintain multiple local player profiles. These profiles track individual stats and are tied to a single user account.

The backend system is built around a RESTful API with a PostgreSQL database. Communication between the Unity client and the server is done via JSON over HTTPS.

---

### üë• User and Player Model

- **User**
  - Represents the logged-in Google account or an anonymous installation
  - Identified by Google ID or locally-generated UUID
  - Can manage multiple `PlayerProfiles`

- **PlayerProfile**
  - Represents a single local player (e.g., ‚ÄúDad‚Äù, ‚ÄúFriend 2‚Äù)
  - Stores persistent stats like score history, win count, and Farkles
  - Associated with a single User

### üîå API Endpoints

#### `POST /game-result`
Submits a completed match with player results.

```json
{
  "user_id": "abc123",
  "game": {
    "played_at": "2025-08-05T12:00:00Z",
    "results": [
      {
        "player_id": "p1",
        "score": 9800,
        "turns": 8,
        "farkles": 2,
        "won": true
      },
      {
        "player_id": "p2",
        "score": 8450,
        "turns": 9,
        "farkles": 3,
        "won": false
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

#### `GET /player-stats?player_id=p1`
Returns persistent stats for a single player profile.

#### `GET /leaderboard?sort=avg_score`
Returns a leaderboard sorted by `avg_score`, `wins`, or `total_points`.

#### `GET /user-players?user_id=abc123`
Returns all `PlayerProfiles` associated with the user.

#### `POST /create-player`
Creates a new player profile under a user account.

```json
{
  "user_id": "abc123",
  "display_name": "Grandma"
}
```

### üîê Identity Management

- Uses **Google Play Games Services** if available
- Falls back to a locally-stored **UUID** for anonymous users
- All data is tied to the `user_id` (either UUID or Google ID)
- No personally identifiable info (PII) is stored
- The Unity client is responsible for persisting and reusing the `user_id`

---

### ‚öñÔ∏è Security and Best Practices

- All backend requests require HTTPS
- Input validation and schema checks are applied to all endpoints
- Rate limiting per `user_id` to prevent abuse
- All UUIDs are generated on the client or server using secure random generators
- Sensitive operations (e.g., deleting players) require additional verification tokens

---

### üåê Hosting Considerations

The backend can be deployed to a lightweight PaaS such as:
- **Render** or **Railway** for Node.js/FastAPI
- **Google Cloud Run** if leveraging Google Auth
- **Supabase** or **PocketBase** for integrated auth + DB as a quick backend

Database hosting can use:
- **Supabase PostgreSQL**
- **Neon.tech**
- **ElephantSQL**

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Data Flow

```
[Game Ends]
   ‚Üì
[Unity BackendService builds payload]
   ‚Üì
[POST /game-result]
   ‚Üì
[Backend stores session + results]
   ‚Üì
[Client fetches player stats, history, and leaderboards]
```

### üîÆ Future Extensions

- Add `achievements` table for milestone tracking
- Implement JWT-based sessions for Google users
- Add `/delete-player` or `/rename-player` endpoints
- Add filtering to game history (`GET /player-history?player_id=p1&page=2`)
- Add weekly/monthly leaderboards with `created_at` filtering
