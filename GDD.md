## Game Description

Farkle is a classic push-your-luck dice game. Players take turns rolling six dice and choosing which to keep for points. The goal is to reach a target score (default: 10,000 points). Players may continue rolling to accumulate more points during their turn â€” but risk losing everything if they Farkle (roll no scoring dice).

The game supports 2+ local players in a pass-and-play format, with persistent player profiles, animated dice rolls, and dynamic UI feedback.

## Core Gameplay

### Objective

Be the first player to reach the target score (default: 10,000 points).

### Turn Flow

1. Start turn â†’ Roll all unheld dice
2. Select scoring dice
3. Choose to roll again or hold and end turn
4. If the roll results in no scoreable dice â†’ Farkle â†’ Lose unbanked points
5. Score carries over only if player banks points via "Hold Dice"
6. Once a player reaches the target score, all others get one final turn
7. Winner is the player with the highest score after final round

### Dice Scoring Rules

- Ones: 100 points each
- Fives: 50 points each
- Three of a kind: face value x100
  - (Three 1s = 1,000)
- Four of a kind: face value x200 (or 2,000 for 1s)
- Five of a kind: face value x300 (or 3,000 for 1s)
- Six of a kind: face value x400 (or 4,000 for 1s)
- Straight (1-6): 1,500 points
- Three pairs: 1,500 points
- Two triplets: 2,500 points

## Systems & Architecture

### Architecture Style

- Modular Singleton-based architecture for core systems (e.g., `TurnManager`, `ScoreManager`, `FarkleGame`, `UIManager`)
- Event-driven communication using `UnityEvent`s
- ScriptableObjects used for configuration (`GameSettings`, `PlayerSettings`)
- Backend communication via `UnityWebRequest` and JSON payloads
- Scene-based structure with additive loading for future menus and overlays

### Core Systems

#### `FarkleGame`

- Central event hub and game state coordinator
- Manages player input lock and main turn resolution loop
- Fires UnityEvents for all gameplay transitions (roll, select, hold, end turn, etc.)

#### `TurnManager`

- Finite State Machine handling turn phases: `START_TURN`, `ROLL_DICE`, `SELECT_DICE`, `END_TURN`, `GAME_OVER`, etc.
- Coordinates UI prompts and state transitions
- Determines final round and winner

#### `ScoreManager`

- Handles calculation and tracking of per-player scores
- Stores turn, selected, and total score
- Evaluates winning score condition and sets `BottomFeedScore`
- Pushes score data to backend when game ends

#### `DiceManager`

- Maintains state of six dice (rolled, held, selected)
- Implements scoring logic for all valid combinations
- Integrates with `ViewController` to animate dice updates

#### `PlayerManager`

- Manages list of `Player` objects (name, score, profile)
- Tracks current and next player based on `TurnManager`
- Handles persistent player stat storage (future: local and cloud sync)

#### `UIManager`

- Manages game UI, buttons, player panel, and splash messages
- Responds to turn state changes
- Controls screen flipping, debug info, and game over display

#### `ViewController`

- Maps dice model data (`Dice[]`) to visual prefab components (`DieView[]`)
- Handles animated dice rolling with variation via DOTween

### BackendService (Planned)

- Singleton MonoBehaviour for RESTful backend calls
- Posts JSON payloads at game end for session tracking
- Retrieves leaderboard, player profile, and stats history
- Integrates with Google Play Games user ID for identity/auth

### Google Play Integration

- Uses Google Play Games SDK to authenticate user
- Maps player profile to authenticated Google user ID
- Stores and retrieves cross-device stats securely
- Future: unlock achievements, sync cloud saves

### Data Flow (Simplified)

```
[User] â†’ [Unity UI] â†’ [FarkleGame] â†’ [TurnManager / DiceManager / ScoreManager]
                                  â†“
                           [UIManager / ViewController]
                                  â†“
                            [GameOver] â†’ [BackendService] â†’ [Web API]
                                                     â†‘
                                            [Google Play Auth]
```

### Persistence

- Player profile saved locally in `PlayerPrefs` or file
- Extended stats and match history pushed to backend via REST
- Backend stores game results in relational DB (e.g., PostgreSQL)
- Support for anonymous ID fallback or full Google Play account linkage..
